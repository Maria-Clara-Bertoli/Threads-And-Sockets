# 🧠💻 Face Detection via Sockets and Concurrent Processing

This repository contains the implementation of a **client-server application** that uses **Sockets** to perform network communication.

📡 The **client** sends images to the server, and the **server** performs **face detection** on the received images.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🤝 Client-server communication via **Sockets**  
- 🖼️ Transmission of **images** from the client to the server  
- 🧍‍♂️ **Face detection** in the received images  
- 🧵 Use of **concurrent processing** to improve performance  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java ☕  
- Sockets 🔌  
- Concurrent processing (threads) ⚡  
- Computer vision libraries (**OpenCV**) 👁️
